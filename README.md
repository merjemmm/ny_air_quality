This is an analysis of a public Kaggle dataset of Air Quality measures in New York.
The dataset used for all analysis can be found at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abidhussai512/air-quality-in-usa>. 

The analysis presented was originally created as the data analysis project as part of the W25 Datathon through the UMich Undergrad Statistics Club. The website is my work and unassociated. 

## Motivation

The Air Quality across the world is worsening. 

“New York City air quality is improving, but our health impact estimates from 2015 to 2017 found that fine particle pollution alone each year caused:
At least 2,000 deaths
About 1,400 hospital admissions for lung and heart conditions
3,750 emergency department admissions for asthma based on levels”
